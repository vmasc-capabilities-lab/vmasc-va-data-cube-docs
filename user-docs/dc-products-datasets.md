# VMASC Data Cube Products

Products are a collection of datasets that share the same set of measurements and additional metadata. The VMASC Data Cube currently contains the following products:

* io_lulc
    * Impact Observatory's [Land Use Land Cover](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/)
        * The Land Use Land Cover Maps are a collection of land classification datasets that were generated by the Impact Observatory using Sentinel-2 products. Nine spectral bands were utilized to create nine different land classifcations of the Earth.

* ls7_c2l2_sr
    * [Registry of Open Data on AWS - USGS Landsat](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-landsat/)
        * Landsat 7 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on April 15, 1999 on a Delta II rocket.
        * The primary features on Landsat 7 include a panchromatic band with 15 meter spatial resolution, an onboard full aperture solar calibrator, five percent absolute radiometric calibration, and a thermal infrared channel with a four-fold improvement in spatial resolution over Thematic Mapper (TM)

* ls8_c2l2_sr
    * [Registry of Open Data on AWS - USGS Landsat](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-landsat/)
      * Landsat-8 is an Earth observation satellite launched into orbit on February 11th, 2013 by a joint collaboration effort by USGS and NASA. Datasets have been produced daily since its launch.
      * The first sensor of Landsat-8, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) records measurements from nine bands. These span the visible, near infrared, and shortwave spectrums.
      * The second sensor of Landsat-8, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) records measurements from two long wavelength infrared bands. These measurements target land surface temperature.

* nasadem
    * [Microsoft's Planetary Computer NASADEM](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/measures/nasadem)
        * The NASA Digital Elevation Model, or NASADEM, are a collection of high spatial resolution datasets derived by reprocessing Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM) data with several other digital elevation models.
        * The STRM was an eleven day global flyover that captured topographic data from Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. This mission took place around Februrary, 2000.

* s2_l2a
    * [Sentinel-2 Level-2a Surface Reflectance products](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/product-types/level-2a)
      * Sentinel-2 refers to an Earth observation mission operated by the European Space Agency. Observation is currently conducted through two satellites, Sentinel-2a (s2a) and Sentinel-2b (s2b). The s2a satellite was launched on June 23rd, 2015, and the s2b satellite was launched on March 7th, 2017.
      * Both satellites measure from the same Multi-Spectral Imager, which collects data from 12 bands. These bands are within the visible, near infrared, shortwave infrared wavelengths.
